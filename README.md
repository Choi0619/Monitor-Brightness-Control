# 🌟 Monitor Brightness Control

## Description
This program was developed by **Gyuhwan Choi** to make it easier to adjust monitor brightness using a simple and intuitive **GUI**. Physical monitor buttons can be tricky to use, so this program allows you to adjust brightness levels quickly and conveniently via software.

## 📋 Features:
- Adjust brightness using a slider or by manually entering a value between **0 and 100**.
- Automatically detects and displays the current brightness level.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 How to Use:
1. Run the program to open the GUI.
2. Use the **slider** to adjust brightness or type a specific value in the input box.
3. The current brightness level is automatically detected and displayed.

## 🔧 Technologies Used:
- **Python** for the core program.
- **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **screen_brightness_control** library for interacting with monitor brightness.

## 🖥️ Why This Was Made:
Adjusting monitor brightness with physical buttons can be difficult, so this program was built to provide a smoother experience when controlling brightness directly from your computer.
